## About

I am a PhD student at the Institut de MathÃ©matiques de Jussieuâ€“Paris Rive Gauche (IMJ-PRG), where I began my doctoral studies in January 2025 under the supervision of [Karim Adiprasito](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/%7Ekarim.adiprasito/). My research interests lie at the intersection of algebraic geometry and combinatorics, with a particular focus on toric geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory.  

During the 2025â€“2026 academic year, I will be a Fulbright scholar at the University of Michigan.  

Prior to my PhD, I earned an MSc in Mathematics (2024) and a BSc in Engineering Physics and Mathematics (2023) from Aalto University. You can find my full CV [here](cv625.pdf).

## About

I am a PhD student at Institut de MathÃ©matiques de Jussieuâ€“Paris Rive Gauche (IMJ-PRG), where I began my doctoral studies in January 2025 under the supervision of [Karim Adiprasito](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/%7Ekarim.adiprasito/). I am interested in the interplay between algebra, geometry and combinatorics, in particular through topics such as toric geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory.

I am supported by the [Osk. Huttunen Foundation](https://oskhuttunen.fi/). For the 2025â€“2026 academic year, I will be a Fulbright scholar at the University of Michigan, funded by a [Fulbright-Technology Industries of Finland](https://www.fulbright.fi/grants-masters-studies/fulbright-technology-industries-finland-grants) grant.

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Mathematics (2024) and a BSc in Engineering Physics and Mathematics (2023) at Aalto University. You can find my full CV [here](cv625.pdf).

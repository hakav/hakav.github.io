## About

I am a PhD student at Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche (IMJ-PRG), where I began my doctoral studies in January 2025 under the supervision of [Karim Adiprasito](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/%7Ekarim.adiprasito/). I am interested in the interplay between algebra, geometry and combinatorics, in particular through topics such as combinatorial Hodge theory, commutative algebra and toric geometry.

I am supported by the [Osk. Huttunen Foundation](https://oskhuttunen.fi/). For the 2025–2026 academic year, I am visiting [David Speyer](https://websites.umich.edu/~speyer/) at the University of Michigan as a Fulbright grantee, funded by a [Fulbright-Technology Industries of Finland](https://www.fulbright.fi/grants-masters-studies/fulbright-technology-industries-finland-grants).

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Mathematics (2024) and a BSc in Engineering Physics and Mathematics (2023) at Aalto University.

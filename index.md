## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at IMJ-PRG / Sorbonne Université, advised by [Karim Adiprasito](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/%7Ekarim.adiprasito/). I am interested in the various interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics, especially toric geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory. I will spend the 2025-26 academic year at the University of Michigan as a Fulbright scholar.  

Previously, I studied at Aalto University, where I completed an MSc in Mathematics (2024) and a BSc in Engineering Physics and Mathematics (2023). My full CV is available [here](cv625.pdf).
